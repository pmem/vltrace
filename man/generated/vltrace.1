.SH NAME

\f[B]vltrace\f[] \-\- extreamely fast strace\-like tool built on top of
eBPF and KProbe technologies.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ vltrace\ [options]\ [command\ [arg\ ...]]
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
vltrace is a limited functional strace equivalent for Linux but based on
eBPF and KProbe technologies and libbcc library.
.SH FEATURES
.IP \[bu] 2
Used combination of technologies allow tool to be about one order faster
than regular system strace.
.IP \[bu] 2
This tool consume much less amount of CPU resource
.IP \[bu] 2
Output of this tool is designed to be suitable for processing with
classical tools and technologies, like awk.
.IP \[bu] 2
Could trace syscalls system\-wide.
.IP \[bu] 2
Could trace init (process with \[aq]pid == 1\[aq]).
Finally we have a proper tool for debugging systemd ;\-)
.PP
WARNING: System\-wide tracing can fill out your disk really fast.
.SH LIMITATIONS
.IP \[bu] 2
Limited functionality
.IP \[bu] 2
Slow attaching and detaching
.IP \[bu] 2
Asynchronity.
If user will not provide enough system resources for performance tool
will skip some calls.
Tool does not assume to try any work\-around behind the scene.
.IP \[bu] 2
Depend on modern kernel features
.IP \[bu] 2
Underlaing eBPF technology still is in active development.
So we should expect hangs and crashes more often as for regular strace,
especially on low\-res systems.
.IP \[bu] 2
Truncating of very long filenames (longer then ~STR_MAX bytes) to
~STR_MAX.
Details:
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2

.RE
.SH Outdated limitations
.PP
Could be useful with old libbcc versions.
.IP \[bu] 2
Limited possibility to run few instances simultaneously.

.SH SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
.IP \[bu] 2
kernel v4.7 or later (to attach eBPF to tracepoints)
.IP \[bu] 2
kernel headers installed:
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
\[aq]kernel\-devel\[aq] package on RHEL, Fedora and CentOS or
.IP \[bu] 2
\[aq]linux\-headers\[aq] package on Debian and Ubuntu
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
libbcc v0.3.0\-150\-g3263805 or later
.IP \[bu] 2
CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (required by the bpf() syscall)
.IP \[bu] 2
mounted tracefs
.SH OPTIONS
.SH Output format:
.PP
\f[C]\-o,\ \-\-output\ <file>\f[]
.PP
filename
.PP
\f[C]\-t,\ \-\-timestamp\f[]
.PP
include timestamp in output
.PP
\f[C]\-l,\ \-\-format\ <fmt>\f[]
.PP
output logs format.
Possible values:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\[aq]bin\[aq],\ \[aq]binary\[aq],\ \[aq]hex\[aq],\ \[aq]hex_raw\[aq],\ \[aq]hex_sl\[aq],\ \[aq]strace\[aq],\ \[aq]list\[aq]\ &\ \[aq]help\[aq].
\f[]
.fi
.IP \[bu] 2
\[aq]bin\[aq]/\[aq]binary\[aq] file format is the fastest one and is
described in generated trace.h.
If current directory is not writable generating of trace.h is skipped.
.IP \[bu] 2
\[aq]hex\[aq]/\[aq]hex_raw\[aq] the fastest text log format.
Records for some calls could be splitted in few lines if used with
\[aq]\-\-filenames name_max\[aq] or like.
.IP \[bu] 2
\[aq]hex_sl\[aq] one\-line text log format.
Assembling syscall\[aq]s record into one line by this tool will improove
readability and simplify processing but could slowdown this tool if used
with \[aq]\-\-filenames name_max\[aq] or \[aq]\-\-filenames full\[aq].
Implementation is not finished and is postponned.
.IP \[bu] 2
\[aq]strace\[aq] is going to emulate usual strace output, but is the
slowest one.
Assume assembling syscall\[aq]s packets into one line.
Implementation is not finished and is postponned.
.PP
Default: \[aq]hex\[aq]
.PP
\f[C]\-K,\ \-\-hex\-separator\ <sep>\f[]
.PP
set field separator for hex logs.
Default is a single space \[aq] \[aq].
.SH Filtering:
.PP
\f[C]\-X,\ \-\-failed\f[]
.PP
only show failed syscalls
.PP
\f[C]\-e,\ \-\-expr\ <expr>\f[]
.PP
expression, \[aq]help\[aq] or \[aq]list\[aq] for supported list.
.PP
Default: kp\-all.
.SH Tracing:
.PP
\f[C]\-f,\ \-\-full\-follow\-fork\f[]
.PP
Follow new processes created with fork()/vfork()/clone() syscall as
regular strace does.
.PP
\f[C]\-ff,\ \-\-full\-follow\-fork=f\f[]
.PP
Same as above, but put logs for each process in separate file with name
<file>.pid Implementation is not finished and is postponned.
.PP
\f[C]\-fff,\ \-\-full\-follow\-fork=ff\f[]
.PP
Same as above, but put logs for each thread in separate file with name
<file>.tid.pid Implementation is not finished and is postponned.
.PP
\f[C]\-n,\ \-\-filenames\ <mode>\f[]
.PP
eBPF virtual machine is extremely limited in available memory.
Also currently there are no ways to calculate a len of strings.
For this reason we introduced four modes of fetching file\-names: \-
\[aq]fast\[aq] \- everything what we could not fit into single packet
will be truncated.
\- \[aq]name_max\[aq] \- fetch\-up STR_MAX bytes of name.
Every name will be sent via separate packet.
Processing of that packets is controlled by output log format.
\- \[aq]number\[aq] \- fetch\-up \[aq]number * STR_MAX\[aq] bytes of
name.
Every part of name will be sent via separate packet.
Processing of that packets is controlled by output log format.
Minimal accepted value: 1.
Implementation is not finished and is postponned.
\- \[aq]full\[aq] \- will be implemented as soon as this issue will be
fixed: https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/issues/900
.PP
Default: fast
.SH Startup:

.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
** System Configuring **
.IP "1." 3
You should provide permissions to access tracefs for final user
according to your distro documentation.
Some of possible options:
.RS 4
.IP \[bu] 2
In /etc/fstab add mode=755 option for debugfs AND tracefs.
.IP \[bu] 2
Use sudo
.RE
.IP "2." 3
It\[aq]s good to put this command in init scripts such as local.rc:
.RS 4
.PP
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_enable
.PP
It will significantly improve performance and avoid \[aq]Lost
events\[aq]
.RE
.IP "3." 3
You should increase "Open File Limit" according to your distro
documentation.
Few common ways you can find in this instruction:
.RS 4
.PP
https://easyengine.io/tutorials/linux/increase\-open\-files\-limit/
.RE
.IP "4." 3
Kernel headers for running kernel should be installed.
.IP "5." 3
CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability should be provided for user for bpf() syscall.
In the newest kernel (4.10 ?) there is alternate option, but your should
found it youself.
.SH FILES
.PP
Putting into directory, supplied with \-N option, modified template
files allow to customize eBPF code for supporting more newer eBPF VM
features in newer kernels.
.PP
Also if current directory does not contain trace.h file, vltrace on
first start saves built\-in trace.h into current directory.
Saved built\-in describe binary log\[aq]s format.
.IP \[bu] 2
trace.h
.IP \[bu] 2
\&...
.PP
The rest of files could be figured out by looking into debug output,
into eBPF source code.
