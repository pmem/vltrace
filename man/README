vltrace

This is man/README.

This directory contains source for the man page.

All files in the *generated* directory are automatically generated.
**DO NOT MODIFY THE FILES IN THAT DIRECTORY**. All changes to the
documentation are to be made by modifying the \*.md files in the main doc
directory.

To create more readable text files from the source, use:
	$ make
An even more convenient way to read these is to use the "man" command to
format them (includes bold, underline, etc. when run in a terminal window):
	$ man -l vltrace.1
