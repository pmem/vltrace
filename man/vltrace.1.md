# NAME #

**vltrace** -- extreamely fast strace-like tool built on top of eBPF
and KProbe technologies.


# SYNOPSIS #

```
$ vltrace [options] [command [arg ...]]
```


# DESCRIPTION #

vltrace is a limited functional strace equivalent for Linux but based on
eBPF and KProbe technologies and libbcc library.

# FEATURES #

 - Used combination of technologies allow tool to be about one order faster
   than regular system strace.
 - This tool consume much less amount of CPU resource
 - Output of this tool is designed to be suitable for processing with
   classical tools and technologies, like awk.
 - Could trace syscalls system-wide.
 - Could trace init (process with 'pid == 1'). Finally we have a proper
   tool for debugging systemd ;-)

WARNING: System-wide tracing can fill out your disk really fast.

# LIMITATIONS #

 - Limited functionality
 - Slow attaching and detaching
 - Asynchronity. If user will not provide enough system resources for
   performance tool will skip some calls. Tool does not assume to try
   any work-around behind the scene.
 - Depend on modern kernel features
 - Underlaing eBPF technology still is in active development. So we should
   expect hangs and crashes more often as for regular strace, especially on
   low-res systems.
 - Truncating of very long filenames (longer then ~STR_MAX bytes) to ~STR_MAX.
   Details:
    - https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/issues/900

# Outdated limitations

Could be useful with old libbcc versions.

 - Limited possibility to run few instances simultaneously.
   Details:
    - https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/pull/918
    - https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/issues/872

# SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS #

 - kernel v4.7 or later (to attach eBPF to tracepoints)
 - kernel headers installed:
    - 'kernel-devel' package on RHEL, Fedora and CentOS or
    - 'linux-headers' package on Debian and Ubuntu
 - libbcc v0.3.0-150-g3263805 or later
 - CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (required by the bpf() syscall)
 - mounted tracefs

# OPTIONS #

#Output format:

`-o, --output <file>`

filename

`-t, --timestamp`

include timestamp in output

`-l, --format <fmt>`

output logs format. Possible values:

	'bin', 'binary', 'hex', 'hex_raw', 'hex_sl', 'strace', 'list' & 'help'.

 - 'bin'/'binary' file format is the fastest one and is described in generated
   trace.h. If current directory is not writable generating of trace.h
   is skipped.

 - 'hex'/'hex_raw' the fastest text log format. Records for some calls could be
   splitted in few lines if used with '--filenames name_max' or like.

 - 'hex_sl' one-line text log format. Assembling syscall's record into one line
   by this tool will improove readability and simplify processing but could
   slowdown this tool if used with '--filenames name_max' or '--filenames full'.
   Implementation is not finished and is postponned.

 - 'strace' is going to emulate usual strace output, but is the slowest one.
   Assume assembling syscall's packets into one line.
   Implementation is not finished and is postponned.

Default: 'hex'

`-K, --hex-separator <sep>`

set field separator for hex logs. Default is a single space ' '.


#Filtering:
`-X, --failed`

only show failed syscalls

`-e, --expr <expr>`

expression, 'help' or 'list' for supported list.

Default: kp-all.

#Tracing:

`-f, --full-follow-fork`

Follow new processes created with fork()/vfork()/clone()
syscall as regular strace does.

`-ff, --full-follow-fork=f`

Same as above, but put logs for each process in
separate file with name \<file\>\.pid
Implementation is not finished and is postponned.

`-fff, --full-follow-fork=ff`

Same as above, but put logs for each thread in
separate file with name \<file\>\.tid.pid
Implementation is not finished and is postponned.

`-n, --filenames <mode>`

eBPF virtual machine is extremely limited in available memory. Also currently
there are no ways to calculate a len of strings. For this reason we introduced
four modes of fetching file-names:
 - 'fast' - everything what we could not fit into single packet will be
   truncated.
 - 'name_max' - fetch-up STR_MAX bytes of name. Every name will be sent
   via separate packet. Processing of that packets is controlled by output
   log format.
 - 'number' - fetch-up 'number * STR_MAX' bytes of name. Every part of name
   will be sent via separate packet. Processing of that packets is controlled
   by output log format. Minimal accepted value: 1.
   Implementation is not finished and is postponned.
 - 'full' - will be implemented as soon as this issue will be fixed:
   https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/issues/900

Default: fast

#Startup:
`-p, --pid <pid>`

trace this PID only. In current version `command` arg should be missing.
Press (CTRL-C) to send interrupt signal to exit.
Note
```
-p "`pidof PROG`"
```
syntax.

`-N, --ebpf-src-dir <dir>`

Enable checking of updated ebpf templates in directory \<dir\>\.

#Miscellaneous:
`-d, --debug`

enable debug output

`-h, --help`

print help

`-L, --list`

Print a list of all traceable syscalls of the running kernel.

`-R, --ll-list`

Print a list of all traceable low-level funcs of the running kernel.

WARNING: really long. ~45000 functions for 4.4 kernel.

`-B, --builtin-list`

Print a list of all known syscalls.


# CONFIGURATION #

** System Configuring **

1. You should provide permissions to access tracefs for final user
   according to your distro documentation. Some of possible options:

    - In /etc/fstab add mode=755 option for debugfs AND tracefs.
    - Use sudo

2. It's good to put this command in init scripts such as local.rc:

	echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_enable

	It will significantly improve performance and avoid 'Lost events'

3. You should increase "Open File Limit" according to your distro documentation.
   Few common ways you can find in this instruction:

    https://easyengine.io/tutorials/linux/increase-open-files-limit/

4. Kernel headers for running kernel should be installed.

5. CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability should be provided for user for bpf() syscall.
   In the newest kernel (4.10 ?) there is alternate option, but your should
   found it youself.


# FILES #

Putting into directory, supplied with -N option, modified template files
allow to customize eBPF code for supporting more newer eBPF VM features in
newer kernels.

Also if current directory does not contain trace.h file, vltrace on first
start saves built-in trace.h into current directory. Saved built-in describe
binary log's format.

 - trace.h
 - ...

The rest of files could be figured out by looking into debug output, into eBPF
source code.
