This directory contains very basic functional tests of vltrace.


** REQUIREMENTS **

The tests require CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability so they have to be run as root
or using the 'sudo' command.


** COMPILATION **

In order to run the tests you should first build the whole project running:

$ make

in the build directory.


** RUNNING THE TESTS **

You can start the tests in the silent way by running:

$ sudo make test

or in the verbose way using 'ctest' command:

$ sudo ctest -V

For all ctest's options see the ctest's documentation:

https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html
