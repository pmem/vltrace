Startup:
    -p, --pid    <pid>
        Trace this PID only, <command> option should be missing.
        Press (CTRL-C) to send interrupt signal to exit.
        Note -p "`pidof PROG`" syntax.
    -N, --ebpf-src-dir <dir>
        Enable checking of updated ebpf templates in directory <dir>.

Output format:
    -o, --output <file>
        log filename
    -t, --timestamp
        include timestamp in output
    -l, --format <fmt>
        output logs format. Possible values:
        'bin', 'binary', 'hex', 'hex_raw', 'hex_sl', 'strace', 'list' & 'help'.
        - 'bin'/'binary' file format is the fastest one and is described
              in trace.h.
        - 'hex'/'hex_raw' is the fastest text format.
        - 'hex_sl' is compromized single-line text format. If used with
              '--filenames name_max' or '--filenames full' could be slow.
              Implementation is not finished.
        - 'strace' is going to emulate usual strace output, but is the
              slowest one.
              Implementation is not finished.
        Default: 'hex'
    -K, --hex-separator <sep>
        set field separator for hex logs. Default is a single space ' '.

Filtering:
    -X, --failed
        only show failed syscalls
    -e, --expr   <expr>
        expression, 'help' or 'list' for supported list.
        Default: trace=all

Tracing:
    -f, --full-follow-fork
        Follow new processes created with fork()/vfork()/clone() syscall as
        regular strace does.
    -ff, --full-follow-fork=f
        Same as above, but put logs for each process in separate file with
        name <file>.pid
        Implementation is not finished and is postponned.
    -fff, --full-follow-fork=ff
        Same as above, but put logs for each thread in separate file with
        name <file>.tid.pid
        Implementation is not finished and is postponned.
    -n, --filenames <mode>
        Mode of fetching filenames:
        - 'fast' - everything what we could not fit into single packet will
            be truncated.
        - 'name_max' - fetch-up STR_MAX bytes of name. Every name will be sent
            via separate packet. Processing of that packets is controlled by
            output log format
        - 'number' - fetch-up 'number * STR_MAX' bytes of name. Every part of
            name will be sent via separate packet. Processing of that packets
            is controlled by output log format. Minimal accepted value: 1.
            Implementation is not finished and is postponned.
        - 'full' - will be implemented as soon as this issue will be fixed:
              https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/issues/900
        Default: fast

Miscellaneous:
    -d, --debug
        enable debug output
    -h, --help
        print help
    -L, --list
        Print a list of all traceable syscalls of the running kernel.
    -R, --ll-list
        Print a list of all traceable low-level funcs of the running kernel.
        WARNING: really long. ~45000 functions.
    -B, --builtin-list
        Print a list of all known syscalls.

Examples:
    ./vltrace           # trace all syscalls in the system
    ./vltrace ls        # trace syscalls of ls command
    ./vltrace -p 342    # only trace PID 342
