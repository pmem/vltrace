# Contributing to vltrace

Here you'll find instructions on how to contribute to vltrace.

Your contributions are most welcome!  You'll find it is best to begin
with a conversation about your changes, rather than just writing a bunch
of code and contributing it out of the blue.
The only way to suggest new features, offer to add a feature,
or just begin a dialog about the vltrace is:

* Open an issue in GitHub

**NOTE: If you do decide to implement code changes and contribute them,
please make sure you agree your contribution can be made available
under the [BSD-style License used for the vltrace]

**NOTE: Submitting your changes also means that you certify the following:**

```
Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

In case of any doubt, the gatekeeper may ask you to certify the above in writing,
i.e. via email or by including a `Signed-off-by:` line at the bottom
of your commit comments.

To improve tracking of who is the author of a contribution, we kindly ask you
to use your real name (not an alias) when commiting your changes to the vltrace:
